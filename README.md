# PHP-Gaming-Player-Database
Black Desert Online Player database in PHP using the MVC framework. Tracks player stats allowing players to connect with others and find them in game


One of my first, extensive projects I ever did using PHP. Learned a lot and really grew as a developer from this project on.
